Developing and retaining a sustainable pipeline of environmental health professionals across a range of related disciplines including fundamental science,
exposure science, translation, policy, and outreach, through efforts in education, training, and career development, and raising the level
of environmental health literacy
of the general population and all other NIEHS stakeholders
 
NIEHS will facilitate development of a cadre of top-notch, innovative and dedicated environmental health scientists and professionals. Within the scientific enterprise, researchers who are open to transdisciplinary approaches need to be developed, recruited, and trained from across a wide range of disciplines, in order to meet the NIEHS mission of solving the increasingly complex problems in environmental health. Examples include not only traditional basic biological, medical, and population sciences, such as toxicology and epidemiology, but also translational sciences, data and information sciences, veterinary medicine, chemistry, engineering, biostatistics, health economics, bioethics, risk communication, behavioral sciences, and others.
In tandem with the development of the scientific cadre, NIEHS must also seek to develop a base of professionals who can translate the scientific knowledge into policy, education, communications, and outreach, to meet the needs of NIEHS stakeholders.
Efforts in both of these areas should include specific focus on increasing the involvement of underrepresented groups in environmental health research, on the use of integrative and collaborative approaches, and on effectively relating environmental health science
to actual public health problems that need solutions. NIEHS needs to emphasize the real-world relevance of its scientific efforts, to make environmental health sciences an exciting and enticing field of study and career.
Getting children excited about environmental health science at an early age helps sustain pipeline of future researchers. Efforts in this area not only introduce new researchers into the field, but also provide a framework for education that improves overall environmental health literacy, with the capacity to affect understanding, behavior, and health outcomes across the age spectrum. Thus, environmental health
literacy embedded in early education is a necessary condition both for the environmental health scientist pipeline and for wider health promotion and disease prevention efforts.
