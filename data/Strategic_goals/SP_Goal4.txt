Understand how combined environmental exposures affect disease pathogenesis.

a.	Assess the joint action of multiple environmental insults, including chemicals, nonchemical stressors, and nutritional components, on toxicity and disease, and identify interactions resulting from combined exposures.
b.	Study the role of the human microbiome and its influence on environmental health, and explore the role of the microbiome in responses to environmental exposures.
c.	Study the interactions of infectious agents with environmental exposures.

d.	Understand how nonchemical stressors, including socioeconomic, behavioral factors, etc., interact with other environmental exposures to impact human health outcomes, and identify preventive measures that could be taken.
