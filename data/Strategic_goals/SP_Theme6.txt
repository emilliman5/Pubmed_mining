Advancing translation and dissemination of scientific knowledge on the role of the
environment and human health and pursuing appropriate and effective means of engagement of the broad range of Institute stakeholders in environmental health research and public health promotion
 
A part of the congressionally mandated purpose of NIEHS is the dissemination of research findings, knowledge, and information on environmental health science. Because the prevention of illness and the improvement of public health are central to the mission
and vision of NIEHS, this mandate is interpreted broadly and covers a wide range of communication activities.
In order to be successful in these activities, NIEHS must continue to develop, refine, and implement an innovative and comprehensive communication and engagement strategy that draws on the latest in best practices, standards, and technologies established by professional communications practitioners and researchers.
Communication and engagement activities provide information that can be easily understood and applied by the range of NIEHS stakeholders, including decision-makers at all levels,
from individuals to global organizations. A good communication strategy for NIEHS features two-way engagement with our stakeholders and is deployed both internally and with external partners to develop a broad constituency for environmental health sciences.
