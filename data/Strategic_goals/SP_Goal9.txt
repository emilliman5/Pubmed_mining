Inspire a diverse and well-trained cadre of scientists to move our transformative environmental health science forward, and train the next generation of EHS leaders from a wider range of scientific disciplines and diverse backgrounds.
a.	Foster cross-disciplinary training in areas that are necessary, but underrepresented, in EHS, e.g., informatics, engineering, biobehavioral, etc.
b.	Recruit trainees from other disciplines to diversify our science base.

c.	Ensure effective opportunities across the entire career trajectory, for young investigatorsâ€™ transition to independence, and for retraining midcareer scientists and other EHS professionals.
d.	Promote the integration of EHS into medical education to increase the number of physician or nurse researchers who are trained in EHS.
e.	Build environmental health research capacity in those countries around the world experiencing the greatest burden of death, disease, and disability due to environmental factors.
f.	Increase diversity within training programs for environmental health scientists.
