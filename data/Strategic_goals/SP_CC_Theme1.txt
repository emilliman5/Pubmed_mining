Environmental effects on health and disease are complex, and understanding these effects requires an integrated and comprehensive approach to data management. The pace of data generation in environmental health sciences has surpassed the existing infrastructure for information acquisition, management, analysis, visualization, and dissemination. The various issues around information, data, and knowledge management comprise an overarching issue with implications applicable to all the strategic planning themes.
There is a broad consensus in the scientific community that more informatics expertise and resources are required to support environmental health sciences research. Emerging technologies allow for transformative analysis of genome structure and sequence, transcriptome, epigenome, metabolome, proteome, exposome, phenome, etc., but currently the field of environmental health sciences has relied on other disciplines to define the bioinformatic parameters necessary for data integration. While environmental health sciences has made some progress within these constraints, it has become apparent that dedicated strategic investments of resources
are necessary to support the information and knowledge needs of the multiple disciplines within the environmental health sciences. Strategies that facilitate
integration of such data, in the context of environmental exposures, would permit greater synergy among environmental health science researchers and improve our basic understanding of environmentally associated diseases. Across the environmental health sciences community, there is a need for centralizing, accessing, and analyzing diverse environmental health data through public resources. A path forward could include leveraging multiple sources of existing data, which are now unconnected, and create better ways to connect and access these data, to address pressing environmental health questions into the future.
