Crosscutting Theme: Collaborative and Integrative Approaches

 
An overarching theme identified during the NIEHS strategic planning process is the importance of collaborative and integrative approaches to environmental health sciences. Adverse effects leading to disease occur at multiple points throughout complex systems, often from multiple exposures and across various life stages. The research enterprise for environmental health  sciences needs to be positioned to exploit all relevant disciplines in a coordinated, integrated fashion to solve these complex problems.
Environmental health scientists need to be enabled to work across a wide array of fields, such as cell and molecular biology, structural biology, biochemistry, genetics, pharmacology, toxicology, epidemiology, biostatistics, behavioral sciences, engineering, and many others. Systems biology, computational biology, and other promising new approaches are dependent
on interdisciplinary collaborations. In addition to interdisciplinary approaches to
 
 
Coordinated activities in research, communication, capacity building, and evaluation.
 
fulfilling its science mission, NIEHS must also work to develop innovative collaborations
with sister agencies, communities, and other partners, to effectively translate this knowledge,
to inform prevention and interventions, as well as to guide stakeholder decision-making at all levels.
