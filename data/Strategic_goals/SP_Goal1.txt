Identify and understand fundamental shared mechanisms or common biological pathways, e.g., inflammation, epigenetic changes, oxidative stress, mutagenesis, etc., underlying a broad range of complex diseases, in order to enable the development of applicable prevention and intervention strategies.
a.	Investigate the effects of the environment on genome structure and function.

b.	Investigate the effects of the environment on the epigenetic regulation of biological and pathological processes.

c.	Understand the role of key biological mechanisms and their regulation in determining resistance and susceptibility to environmental stressors.
d.	Understand the normal processes of human development, maturation, and aging, and identify environmental factors that contribute to altered function.
e.	Develop a pipeline to integrate high-throughput screening, cell systems, and model organisms, to identify fundamental mechanisms underlying responses to existing and emerging environmental toxicants, and to better predict their relationship to disease.
