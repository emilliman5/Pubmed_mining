Identify and respond to emerging environmental threats to human health, on both a local and global scale.

a.	Enlist the capacity of the environmental health science (EHS) research enterprise to elucidate information necessary for timely and effective public health action.
b.	Act proactively with other public health partners to provide appropriate responses to emerging environmental threats, both natural and man-made.
c.	Focus on research needs to help inform policy responses in public health situations in which lack of knowledge hampers policymaking, e.g., health effects of exposures related to hydrofracking or climate change, or exposures to engineered nanomaterials.
