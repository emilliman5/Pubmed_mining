Understand individual susceptibility across the life span to chronic, complex diseases resulting from environmental factors, in basic and population-based studies, to facilitate prevention and decrease public health burden.
a.	Using a life-span approach, identify critical windows of susceptibility to the effects of environmental exposures.

b.	Deepen our understanding of dose-response relationships to environmental factors across the life span.

c.	Study the factors that determine individual susceptibility to environmental stressors across the life span.
